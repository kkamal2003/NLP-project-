# NLP Project Description

## Part 1: Objective

### Getting the Data
- **Source:** We are obtaining data from Science The Wire.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Collection:** Gathering transcripts of various news articles in genres like education, health, and science.
  2. **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise and irrelevant content to ensure the data is usable.
  3. **Data Organization:** Structuring the cleaned data to facilitate input into other algorithms.

### Output
- **Formats:**
  1. **Corpus:** A collection of cleaned text.
  2. **Document-Term Matrix:** Word counts in a matrix format.

### Problem Statement
Analyze the transcripts of various news articles across different genres (education, health, and science) to identify their similarities and differences.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Introduction
After cleaning and organizing the data into standard formats, the next step is to explore the data to ensure it makes sense. Before applying advanced algorithms, it's crucial to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover obvious patterns.

### Techniques
1. **Most Common Words:** Identify and create word clouds for the most frequent words.
2. **Vocabulary Size:** Analyze the number of unique words and the speed of speech.
3. **Profanity:** Detect and assess the use of offensive or socially unacceptable language.

## Part 3: Sentiment Analysis

### Introduction
Following the general analysis, we apply specific techniques like sentiment analysis to understand the text's emotional tone.

### Key Points
- **TextBlob Module:** Utilizes linguistic researchers' labeled sentiments based on domain expertise.
- **Sentiment Labels:** Words are labeled in terms of polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity (opinionated/factual).
  - **Polarity:** Ranges from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive).
  - **Subjectivity:** Ranges from 0 (fact) to +1 (opinion).

## Part 4: Topic Modeling

### Introduction
Topic modeling is a technique to discover various topics within a corpus. Each document may contain one or more topics.

### Steps
1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** A specific topic modeling technique designed for text data.
2. **Inputs:** Requires a document-term matrix and the number of topics.
3. **Interpretation:** Human interpretation of results to ensure the topics make sense. Adjust parameters or models as needed.

## Part 5: Text Generation

### Introduction
Markov chains offer a basic method for text generation by assuming each word depends only on the previous word.

### Key Points
- **Markov Chains:** Basic assumption that the next word depends on the previous word.
- **Comparison to Deep Learning:** Although not as advanced as deep learning, Markov chains provide a simple and fun start to text generation.

This project aims to leverage various NLP techniques to analyze and generate text, providing insights and practical applications in understanding and utilizing text data.
