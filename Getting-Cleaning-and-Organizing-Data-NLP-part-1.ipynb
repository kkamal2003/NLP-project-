It aims to revolutionise the research and development (R&D) ecosystem in India by bringing in significant additional investment from the government, private sector and international collaborations.\\nThe NRF has a vision to promote long-term innovative research across\\nbasic sciences, humanities and social sciences\\nin a bid to position India as a global superpower.\\nHowever, for that to happen, the existing issues in the research ecosystem need to be addressed.\\nOne significant issue is acquiring, retaining and nurturing top-quality research talent. Of particular importance are doctoral students, who are arguably the most affected by problems in the existing setup.\\nIt is no surprise that doctoral students are not paid well, their salaries are often not disbursed on time and they are not offered enough opportunities to promote their research at international conferences and publish in open-access journals.\\nHowever, one overlooked issue is that there is an age limit on the doctoral research fellowship offered by the Union government.\\nThis age limit should be called into question in today’s society, especially at a time when India is looking to become an R&D giant and is looking for all the available talent. It limits a section of society from pursuing a career in academia and/or research, demotivates talented students and also has other consequences, discussed in more detail below.\\nAlso Read:\\nThe Two Faces of India’s New Science and Tech Policy\\nIndia understands the value of doctorates, given that it produces the fourth-highest number of doctoral students every year. The junior research fellowship, or JRF, is how the Union government funds graduate research – approximately\\n10% of all PhD students are financed through the JRF\\n(as per the UGC’s annual report 2020-21, 226,484 students are pursuing Ph.D./M.Phil., of which 24,257 are doing so through the JRF).\\nBut to be eligible for this fellowship, general category students must be\\n28 years old or younger\\n, with relaxations for female students and those from Scheduled Castes/Tribes, OBC communities and persons with disabilities.\\nTo illustrate how strange this age limit is, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the median age of students entering a doctoral degree is\\n29 years\\n, one year older than the JRF age limit.\\nThe Ministry of Education has been actively involved in crafting different policies related to doctoral education. One such measure is mandating that universities fill\\nat least 40%\\nof their admission seats through entrance tests other than the JRF.\\nWhile this is helpful, the fellowships available at universities, especially private ones, are far fewer than JRF. And while public universities may have more fellowships, many of them\\nimpose the same age limit\\nof 28 years.\\nMore importantly, such a low age limit can discourage people from applying. It sends a message to that people older than a certain age do not have what it takes to do a PhD. This is not the case. People of any age can contribute to research and could use their experiences to bring in diverse perspectives.\\nAlso Read:\\nA PhD in Chemistry Doesn’t Mean You’ll Find a Good Job in India\\nThe ineligibility for JRF may force them to choose careers they are less inclined to, pursue a PhD without funding and incur a significant financial burden, or study outside India and worsen the already severe\\nbrain drain problem\\n.\\nThere are many reasons why someone may choose to delay their pursuit of a doctoral degree, including family obligations, health issues and exploring alternative careers. If India is to produce pioneering research, it needs all the world-class talent it can get. Restricting skilled researchers from getting funding based on age feels like shooting oneself in the foot.\\nRemoving the age-based restriction is unlikely to cause additional problems. The selection of fellows for the JRF is done based on the National Eligibility Test (NET). Of all the applicants who clear the exam, only the top 6% are awarded the fellowship. Performance in NET is thus a sufficient criterion for choosing fellows and there is no need for additional restrictions such as age limits.\\nWhile there would be increased competition if people of all ages are considered for fellowship positions, the selection process would also be fair for everyone.\\nIn the US, the JRF equivalent is the\\nNSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program\\n. In the UK, it is the\\nUKRI studentship programme\\n. Neither of them has an age limit.\\nIt is understandable to have eligibility restrictions for the stage of research someone is in. However, age is not the only indicator for that, as many individuals transition careers at a later stage in their lives. They, too, need the same kind of support early on in their research career.\\nTherefore, the NRF should abolish all age-based eligibility restrictions from the JRF and other doctoral research funding opportunities. Because age is just a number.\\nPankaj Bhambhani is a science communicator.\\nPankaj Bhambhani\\n26/10/2023\\nShare\\nTweet\\nShare\\nShare\\nFollow us\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nContact us\\nGeneral enquiries:\\nscience@thewire.in\\nRelated Posts\\nEnvironment\\nSilence of the Wolves: How Human Landscapes Alter Howling Behaviour\\nEnvironment\\nAfter Intense Debates About Timelines, Next IPCC Synthesis Report to Arrive in 2029\\nFeature\\nWhy Less Sleep Cannot Make Workers More Productive\\nHealth\\nWhy We Shouldn’t Lose Our Minds Over Sleep\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nScroll To Top\\nPRESS ESC TO CLOSE'"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We are going to change this to key: comedian, value: string format\ndef combine_text(list_of_text):\n    '''Takes a list of text and combines them into one large chunk of text.'''\n    combined_text = ''.join(list_of_text)\n    return combined_text","metadata":{},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Combine it!\ndata_combined = {key: [combine_text(value)] for (key, value) in data.items()}","metadata":{},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We can either keep it in dictionary format or put it into a pandas dataframe\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('max_colwidth',150)\n\ndata_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data_combined).transpose()\ndata_df.columns = ['transcript']\ndata_df = data_df.sort_index()\ndata_df","metadata":{},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"execution_count":12,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>transcript</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file1</th>\n","      <td>Opinion: It Is Time To Rethink Age Restrictions for Govt Research Fellowships – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEd...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file10</th>\n","      <td>MP’s MBBS in Hindi Policy Overlooks the Many Faces of Language in Education – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEduc...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file11</th>\n","      <td>It Is Time We Acknowledge Student Suicides as a Grave Crisis – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nFacebook...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file12</th>\n","      <td>Post-Pandemic Schooling Has Revived a Terrible Idea: Rushed Classrooms – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file13</th>\n","      <td>Indian Science Institutes’ Curious Penchant for Gendered Hostels – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nFace...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file14</th>\n","      <td>Plagiarism: AI Is Making It Easier Than Ever for Students to Cheat – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nFa...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file15</th>\n","      <td>Interview: The Threat of Self-Censorship in Science – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nFacebook\\nTwitter...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file16</th>\n","      <td>The Sahara Desert Used To Be a Green Savannah and New Research Explains Why – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEduc...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file17</th>\n","      <td>US and UK Approve Gene Editing Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease – The Wire Science\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nFacebo...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file18</th>\n","      <td>Can ChatGPT Play a Productive Role in Science Education?

It aims to revolutionise the research and development (R&D) ecosystem in India by bringing in significant additional investment from the government, private sector and international collaborations.\\nThe NRF has a vision to promote long-term innovative research across\\nbasic sciences, humanities and social sciences\\nin a bid to position India as a global superpower.\\nHowever, for that to happen, the existing issues in the research ecosystem need to be addressed.\\nOne significant issue is acquiring, retaining and nurturing top-quality research talent. Of particular importance are doctoral students, who are arguably the most affected by problems in the existing setup.\\nIt is no surprise that doctoral students are not paid well, their salaries are often not disbursed on time and they are not offered enough opportunities to promote their research at international conferences and publish in open-access journals.\\nHowever, one overlooked issue is that there is an age limit on the doctoral research fellowship offered by the Union government.\\nThis age limit should be called into question in today’s society, especially at a time when India is looking to become an R&D giant and is looking for all the available talent. It limits a section of society from pursuing a career in academia and/or research, demotivates talented students and also has other consequences, discussed in more detail below.\\nAlso Read:\\nThe Two Faces of India’s New Science and Tech Policy\\nIndia understands the value of doctorates, given that it produces the fourth-highest number of doctoral students every year. The junior research fellowship, or JRF, is how the Union government funds graduate research – approximately\\n10% of all PhD students are financed through the JRF\\n(as per the UGC’s annual report 2020-21, 226,484 students are pursuing Ph.D./M.Phil., of which 24,257 are doing so through the JRF).\\nBut to be eligible for this fellowship, general category students must be\\n28 years old or younger\\n, with relaxations for female students and those from Scheduled Castes/Tribes, OBC communities and persons with disabilities.\\nTo illustrate how strange this age limit is, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the median age of students entering a doctoral degree is\\n29 years\\n, one year older than the JRF age limit.\\nThe Ministry of Education has been actively involved in crafting different policies related to doctoral education. One such measure is mandating that universities fill\\nat least 40%\\nof their admission seats through entrance tests other than the JRF.\\nWhile this is helpful, the fellowships available at universities, especially private ones, are far fewer than JRF. And while public universities may have more fellowships, many of them\\nimpose the same age limit\\nof 28 years.\\nMore importantly, such a low age limit can discourage people from applying. It sends a message to that people older than a certain age do not have what it takes to do a PhD. This is not the case. People of any age can contribute to research and could use their experiences to bring in diverse perspectives.\\nAlso Read:\\nA PhD in Chemistry Doesn’t Mean You’ll Find a Good Job in India\\nThe ineligibility for JRF may force them to choose careers they are less inclined to, pursue a PhD without funding and incur a significant financial burden, or study outside India and worsen the already severe\\nbrain drain problem\\n.\\nThere are many reasons why someone may choose to delay their pursuit of a doctoral degree, including family obligations, health issues and exploring alternative careers. If India is to produce pioneering research, it needs all the world-class talent it can get. Restricting skilled researchers from getting funding based on age feels like shooting oneself in the foot.\\nRemoving the age-based restriction is unlikely to cause additional problems. The selection of fellows for the JRF is done based on the National Eligibility Test (NET). Of all the applicants who clear the exam, only the top 6% are awarded the fellowship. Performance in NET is thus a sufficient criterion for choosing fellows and there is no need for additional restrictions such as age limits.\\nWhile there would be increased competition if people of all ages are considered for fellowship positions, the selection process would also be fair for everyone.\\nIn the US, the JRF equivalent is the\\nNSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program\\n. In the UK, it is the\\nUKRI studentship programme\\n. Neither of them has an age limit.\\nIt is understandable to have eligibility restrictions for the stage of research someone is in. However, age is not the only indicator for that, as many individuals transition careers at a later stage in their lives. They, too, need the same kind of support early on in their research career.\\nTherefore, the NRF should abolish all age-based eligibility restrictions from the JRF and other doctoral research funding opportunities. Because age is just a number.\\nPankaj Bhambhani is a science communicator.\\nPankaj Bhambhani\\n26/10/2023\\nShare\\nTweet\\nShare\\nShare\\nFollow us\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nContact us\\nGeneral enquiries:\\nscience@thewire.in\\nRelated Posts\\nEnvironment\\nSilence of the Wolves: How Human Landscapes Alter Howling Behaviour\\nEnvironment\\nAfter Intense Debates About Timelines, Next IPCC Synthesis Report to Arrive in 2029\\nFeature\\nWhy Less Sleep Cannot Make Workers More Productive\\nHealth\\nWhy We Shouldn’t Lose Our Minds Over Sleep\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nThe Sciences\\nHealth\\nEnvironment\\nAerospace\\nEducation\\nScroll To Top\\nPRESS ESC TO CLOSE'"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_df.to_csv('data_df.csv')","metadata":{},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS FOR DATA CLEANING","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def remove_header_footer(text):\n    start_index = text.find(\"Read Next\")\n    end_index = text.find(\"Share\")\n    \n    if start_index != -1 and end_index != -1:\n        return text[start_index:end_index].strip()\n    else:\n        return text  # Return original text if header or footer not found","metadata":{},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"round = lambda x: remove_header_footer(x)\ndata_df = pd.DataFrame(data_df.transcript.apply(round))\ndata_df","metadata":{},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>transcript</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file1</th>\n","      <td>Read Next\\nWhat a 500,000-Year-Old Wooden Structure Says About Our Ancient Relatives\\nThe Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill was\\n...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file10</th>\n","      <td>Read Next\\nHow Fiefdoms and ‘Do or Die’ Imperil the Success of India’s Sportspeople\\nA representative photo of a lecture hall in an Indian univers...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>file11</th>\n","      <td>Read Next\\n7 Years Later, and Still No Clarity on Green Clearance for Ganga Waterway.
